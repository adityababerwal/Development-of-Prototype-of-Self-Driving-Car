# Development-of-Prototype-of-Self-Driving-Car
This repository contains arduino files and android app that I used in my BTech Project during my 4th year at IIT Patna. The project consists of a simple car model on which self-driving capabilities have to be implemented. The project uses an Arduino Uno board, a GPS module (Neo-6M), a Compass module (HMC5883L) and a Bluetooth module (HC-06).
APK for android app (car_control.apk) is included in the repo. For live streaming camera feed, install IP Webcam (by Pavel Khlebovich) on a phone that is on same WiFi network as the controller phone. Click on 'Start Server' option in the app. That opens the camera and provides the IP address to which the live stream is fed. The live stream can be fetched using the IP address, including inside the car_control app.
