# Development-of-Prototype-of-Self-Driving-Car
This repository contains arduino files and android app that I used in my BTech Project during my 4th year at IIT Patna. The project consists of a simple car model on which self-driving capabilities have to be implemented. The project uses an Arduino Uno board, a GPS module (Neo-6M), a Compass module (HMC5883L) and a Bluetooth module (HC-06).
